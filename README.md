Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email message finds you well. My name is Bogdan Cazacu, and I currently work at the NHS Guy's Cancer Center. While I find my work in healthcare deeply rewarding, I am writing to express my strong desire to venture into the field of programming and contribute my skills in a dynamic work environment.
In my own time outside of work, I have dedicated myself to learning the foundations of web development. I have acquired proficiency in HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript through self-guided online resources. My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated by the various small projects I have undertaken, which are accessible on my GitHub account [provide link].
I am particularly interested in applying my programming skills in a practical setting during weekends. I am seeking an opportunity where I can further challenge myself, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to solving real-world problems. The prospect of transitioning from the NHS to a programming-focused environment excites me, as it aligns with my goal to broaden my skill set and engage in problem-solving on a different level.
At this point in my journey, I am primarily focused on gaining valuable experience in the field and contributing to meaningful projects. Therefore, I am not seeking financial compensation for my time and efforts. I believe that this approach will allow me to immerse myself in the programming world and provide me with the hands-on experience I am eager to acquire.
I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm for programming could contribute to your team. I am open to any insights or guidance you may have and would appreciate the chance to learn more about potential opportunities within your company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of learning and contributing to your team.
Sincerely,
Bogdan Cazacu
